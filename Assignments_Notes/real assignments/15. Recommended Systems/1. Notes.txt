Bipartite => Adj-Matrix => T-SVD

* Purpose of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
  -------
  Normally We have 2 Matrix
  1) User Matrix (n*d1)  // d1 dimen is large for n users
  2) Movie Matrix (m*d2)  // d2 dimen is large for m movies

  SVD basically does 2 things :
  a. reduce & helps us to do Feature Engineering/Embedding for Users & Movies
     S.T. we can get lesser dimen than d1 & d2 (ie let say k)

  b. Retains relation between User & Movies (at it best)
     |
     because SVD is just Factorization of Matrix
      So Let consider 6 = 3 * 2
                        \
                        Here Though we get 3 & 2 but reln is maintained by *

      The same way SVD helps us to find better Feature Embedding whilst retaining the
      info at best

NOTE: Reln between User & Movie here is represented by Bipartite-Graph -> Hence Adjacency Matrix
