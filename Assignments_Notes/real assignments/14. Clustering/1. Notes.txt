* CSV :
  ---
  Info about edge between movie & actor

* Bipartite Graph :
  ----
  - Given Data Info is in form of BiPartite Graph
    (i.e Movie <-> Actors)

    So We need to conver this Bipartite Graph Info to Data Matrix Info (ie n*d)
    So that we can easily run clustering alog


* Connected Componente SubGraph

* How to create Features from the Graph ??
  \
   -> Steps

   1. Create Bipartite Graph (in coding) as its the first inherent & natural info avail from
      the dataset

   2. Create Random Walk via help of Connected Sub-Components from BiPartite Graph

   3. Use this each Random Walk/Path as a String
      &
      Try to extract the info from it via W2V or similar Text Processing technique
      (Where you will consider each node in path as a token/word)

* Cost Understanding :
  ---
  - 2 Actor are said to be similar if they works in same movie
  - So when Bipartite Graph is fully connected from Actor to Movie, at that time
    Cost 2 Func would be maximum
